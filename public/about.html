<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm the kind of guy that likes technology, I even have a 3D printer(Sovol SV06) which is nice. I've been tinkering with my 3D printer 
  for some time and made a few cool projects. <br>
  After some time I got bored with printing other people's projects so I started working on my own. FreeCAD was a must, learning it was
  a bit of a hassle, but so worth it. I would recommend it if you're a begginer in making your own 3D designs which you can print.

<p>I'm so in love with my phone that I'm practically glued to it. A useful feat as I'm able to test my webprojects on it. <br>
The world we live in right now has amazing opportunities when it comes to tech, even those limited individuals, that don't have 
access to a pc could work on their mobile phone. <br>
Such amazing times we live in!

  Since technology has taken over our lives, we inadvertedly got used to it and the confort it provides. <br>
  Sadly, the upper mentioned technology can also harm us, but if we're careful about it, then it can do more good than bad. I'm a part
  of a few maker communities and it seems that everybody makes something. The level at which people build things is amazing, enthusiasts
  all over the world share their projects and help others learn about their passion. I was hooked, electronics, 3D printing, programming
  micro controllers and so on... the era of information has surely changed our society to our roots and social media has made it possible
  for us to share our obsession with all things electronic.
