    My main hobby right now is 3D printing, I can't seem to get enough of this. <br>
    3D printing is one of the most interesting things in the world, you choose a file, send it to the printer and it just gets made.
    The fact that you just "make" an object on the fly really intrigues me. You can either download a file or make one using your favourite
    CAD software. My software of choice is FreeCad, you can guess why(it's free). <br>
    I've improved my life and my family's life with this hobby, whenever I needed a practical object it would just get printed
    on my 3D printer. For example: I needed a hook I could screw at the end of a broomstick so I could install Christmas lights on the 
    house. My 3d printer came in handy in this project.
